# Simple Profanity Filter with Regex

This is a simple project that filters out profane words using regex in PHP. It provides functions to check, filter, and remove unwanted words from a text using regex patterns that account for similar characters.

## Features

- **Profanity Check**: Check if a string contains any unwanted words.
- **Profanity Filter**: Remove unwanted words from a text.
- **Profanity Masking**: Replace unwanted words with a masking character, such as `*`.

## Installation

To install this package, you can use Composer:

1. Run the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   composer require kamu/aman
   ```

2. Add the list of words you want to filter in the db/lists.php file.

    ```php
    return [
        'badword1',
        'badword2',
        // Add more words you want to filter
    ];
    ```

## Usage

You can use the Aman class to filter profanity in your application.

### Example Usage

1. Check for Profane Words

    ```php
    use Kamu\Aman;

    $text = "This is an example with bad words.";
    $filter = Aman::factory();

    if ($filter->check($text)) {
        echo "This text contains profanity.";
    } else {
        echo "This text is clean.";
    }
    ```

2. Mask Profane Words

    ```php
    $text = "This is an example with bad words.";
    $maskedText = $filter->masking($text, '*');
    echo $maskedText; // Output: "This is an example with *** ****."
    ```

3. Remove Profane Words

    ```php
    $text = "This is an example with bad words.";
    $cleanText = $filter->filter($text);
    echo $cleanText; // Output: "This is an example with ."
    ```

4. Get Profane Words from Text

    ```php
    $text = "This is an example with bad words.";
    $badWords = $filter->words($text);
    print_r($badWords); // Output: ['bad', 'words']
    ```
